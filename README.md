# Running-Route-Planner
EC601-Team Project
Sprint 1


## Product Definition

### Product Mission
- Locate user position -- Google Map API
- Planning Running Route -- Design algorithm to apply the valuable route(or give some options etc), route can be a cycle and using the ranking

Other targets can be considered:
- Mimic friends route 
- Track user running
- Record everyday training
- Give real-time data to the user 


### Target User(s)
- The people who like to run but do not konw how to plan a route.
- The people who want to follow others' runinng route.

### User Stories
- I, the fresh man in running, would like to know which kind of routes is healthy to me. (how long should I run depends on my height and weight).

- I, the man who often takes exercise, would like to customize running routes based on my favor (distance, begin and end location, incline or flat, included park or far away from road)

- I, as a fresh runner, I don't know how long is 5km and I want to figure out a 5 km long running route in the city

- I, as a runner with some healthy problem on knees, I would like the running route to be more solid rather than multiple dangerous downhills and uphills conditions

- I, the fitness coach/professional runner, would like to share my running routes so that people nearby. It not only will bring more fans with me, but also help people run correctly.

- I, the normal runner, just want mimic friends,  famous people and coach fitness running routes, to get the similar routes as theirs.

### MVP
The app can customize the routes depend on peopleâ€™s need, at least according to distance, begin and end location, and incline of the road.

1. Locate user position -- Google Map API
2. Planning Running Route -- Design algorithm to apply the valuable route(for given options like distance etc), route can be a cycle and using the ranking
3. Mimic friends route 

Other targets can be considered:
1. Track user running
2. Record everyday training
3. Give real-time data to the user
